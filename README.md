## 🔹 Project 1: Web Application Deployment Using Elastic Beanstalk (PHP)

**Problem Statement:**  
The organization wants to deploy a web-based application without managing servers manually. The infrastructure should be fully managed by AWS and scale automatically.

**Tasks Performed:**
1. Created an **Elastic Beanstalk environment** with **PHP runtime**
2. Configured the application environment using AWS-managed resources
3. Uploaded a simple **PHP application file**
4. Verified successful deployment using the Elastic Beanstalk environment URL

**Outcome:**  
Successfully deployed a PHP-based web application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk with minimal server management.

## 🔹 Project 2: Serverless Application Using AWS Lambda and SQS

**Problem Statement:**  
The organization requires a serverless solution where compute resources run only when needed, without keeping servers running continuously.

**Tasks Performed:**
1. Created a **sample Python AWS Lambda function**
2. Configured **Amazon SQS** as the trigger for the Lambda function
3. Sent messages to the SQS queue to test Lambda invocation
4. Verified successful execution through CloudWatch logs

**Outcome:**  
Implemented an event-driven, serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and SQS.
